/*
 * SDLRenderer_SDLThread_EventDispatcher.cs
 *
 * The event dispatcher for the SDLThread has been separated from the rest of the threading code
 * just to keep the file from getting too bulky.  Like that section, don't mess with this unless
 * you know what's what with threads.
 * 
 * These delegates and functions handle callback delegates for the SDL_Window event queue.  Remember
 * that client callbacks will be run in the SDLThread and not the main thread.  All resources should
 * be guarded as needed for a multi-threaded environment.
